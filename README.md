# Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Insurance cost predictions using machine learning and streamlit API
Data analyis was done usinng vsualization with correlation analysis
Different machine leraning algorithms were exercised and voting regressor was used to predict the cost.
Streamlit API was used to build up the user interface
